# Arcgis Android crash test

Minimal example to produce application freeze when using Arcgis version 100.2.0 or 100.3.0 to draw symbols on map.

## How to re-produce

Launch app and move or zoom the map until app freeze occurs.


## Tested with following devices

Tested that 1) App works without freezes when using version 100.1.0. b) Higher version (100.2.0 or 100.3.0) causes
app to freeze.
